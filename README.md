# parkman
The idea of our project is that car can enter into parking and appropriate leave it without any ticket. Cameras will scan specific car plates and count how much hour they spend on parking. When customer decide to leave, on the toll plaza, that has also camera, and will once again scan the license plate and would display final bill.
